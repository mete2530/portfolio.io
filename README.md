### Projects
**Computer Vision Analysis of Knee Radiographs**
- Collaborated with a team of data scientists and surgeons, contributed to creation of an automated image ingestion pipeline for multilabel image-semantic classifier and object detection with knee radiographs.
- Implemented a computer vision algorithm using EfficientNet-based classifier to identify full length hip-knee-ankle (HKA) radiographs in a dataset of over 25,000 images.
- Project resulted in co-authorship in a scientific publication (Journal of Arthroplasty Oct 2024).

**Surgical Site Infection Prediction Models**
- Analyzed dataset of 60,000 surgeries and over 100 variables to develop predictive models for surgical site infections.
- Applied statistical and ML models (lasso regression, ridge, random forest, XGB, neural network) in an effort to achieve high discrimination and better calibration.
- Presented findings and collaborated with mentor and other researchers during weekly meetings.
- Summarized findings in a report as part of my undergraduate independent research project.
